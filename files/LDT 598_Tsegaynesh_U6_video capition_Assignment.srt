Welcome back, this is Dr. Salik, and this is inside Practice Activity number three.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Before we get started with the practice activity, I wanted to talk about a

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
process that will not going to practice in the class,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but it's something you need to be aware of.
If you look at the simulated data sets

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that have been provided for you, you'll see that
they're fairly pristine

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and clean data.
There is a value in every column and

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in every cell.
When you collect data, that's not always the way it works out.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There's usually missing values of values that are incorrect,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and you have to reconcile
us with a process called data cleaning before you begin your analysis.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Data cleaning is the process of preparing data for analysis

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
by removing or modifying data that is incorrect

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
formatted. There is a variety of ways and variety of techniques for doing this.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
generally speaking,
that's an important step before you begin

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
doing your data analysis. There are a variety of ways you can add on your data in analysis. 

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
end up with incomplete or corrupt data in your data set. One example might be

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
somebody starts to take your survey, they lose their internet connection,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
come back at a later time and complete it.
Now you have two rows of data

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
for the same individual, and one of those rows is an incomplete set of

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
values.
In the data cleaning process, you might make a decision to

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
eliminate that set of values.
Data cleaning is an art and

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a science in itself, so in this course, in the simulated data sets I've provided,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
provided, I have already taken care of that step, and the data you'll be using

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
is clean and pristine.
In this practice exercise, you're going

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
going to analyze numerical data that comes from a Likert scale type

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
survey, you're going to review the descriptive statistics for each of the

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
variables you analyze, and then you're going to identify the mean

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and identify the standard deviation. And finally, you'll count
